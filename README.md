# fatat_police_ml

This project aims to probe and better understand the relationship between police violence, socioeconomic indicators, race and geographic location. Using data from the US census, as well as data on individual incidents and their location, I rely on spatial analysis and predictive machine learning to gain insights into where this violence occurs, what factors come into play and how different demographic groups are affected.

To Run the code, simply Run the ipynb notebook. 
You will need to Install GeoPandas, Pysal to be able to run the spatial analysis section. You will need scikit learn for Machine Learning part of the project. 
All data files are provided.
